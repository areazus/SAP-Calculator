# SAP-Calculator

This project is for college students receiving financial aid. It helps them determine if they are meeting the satisfactory academic standards (SAP) set by the Federal government and Brooklyn College to receive Federal Financial Aid.

Students not meeting SAP can make an academic plan to submit with their SAP appeal to reinstate their aid. Once completed, this tool will be made available to students on Brooklyn College website.
